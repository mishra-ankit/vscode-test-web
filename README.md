- Stripped out version of VS Code Test to allow self hosting

- Install dependencies - `yarn`
- Build code and download VS Code Standalone - `yarn build`

- And then you can run static server in the root of 'vsode-web-stable'
    - `serve --cors`

TODO -
- Customizable list of pre loaded extensions
- Make it into npm package
